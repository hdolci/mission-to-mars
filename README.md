# UFO sightings

The purpose of this project is to present a large set of data stored as a Javascript file to the user as a webpage through a web browser. The user will also have filter options to see the exact data needed.

## Results
User can visit the page and entered their desired filters to the left and the table should return the results based on the filters as seen in these screenshots:

## Summary

The desired was achieved although there is one drawback I observed. The table filters are case sensitive and it is not  immediately obvious. There are also two things I believe we can do to improve on this for future development of this project: Some of the filers such as shape should be displayed as a pick list and some of the comments from the table appears to have some type of coding that should be cleaned up.
